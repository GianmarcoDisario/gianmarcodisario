# Gianmarco Disario :rocket:

Welcome! :smiley: I am Gianmarco Disario, a data scientist and cofounder of [Latitude](https://discoverlatitude.com/) in Amsterdam. A boutique data & AI agency based in Amsterdam with a specialty in everything related to customer analytics.

Coming from a background in control (& systems) engineering, my love for everything data & AI related is rooted in a deep understanding of complex systems, probability theory and linear algebra (still thanking [Khan Academy's](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFD0EB975BA0CC1E0) and [3Blue1Brown's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B) linear algebra videos to this day).

Quite often I make a distinction between people coming to data science & AI from either one of four areas: engineering/applied maths, econometric, computer science or who actually studied data science/AI. Each one will be accustomed to a different way of notation, working out and learning things in the field and you notice it when reading their blogs. In this blog I will just stay close to what I know and feel comfortable with. I hope it resonates with you!

This blog was started in early 2024 with [a small blogpost from my previous blog in 2019]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024-02-12-ignoring-cod.md %}) which is still surprisingly relevant with the surgence of the multi-billion parameter models. 

#### Current Focus

As of this writing (Feb. 2024) I am very much getting into the cross-roads of Bayesian modelling and Causal Inference. I am especially impressed by the PyMC project is being extended and also has been revitalised since working with PyMC3 ages ago (and being somewhat scared it was going to be deprecated with the whole Theano ordeal). So please join me in my journey on learning and getting a foundational grasp of a good structural modelling approach.

Next to that I am very much interested in the application area of Customer Lifetime Value, Marketing Mix Models and everything related to Customer Analytics. As to why, I am happy to discuss that in a more philisophical discussion on a call (please connect if you want to discuss over a (virtual) coffee). :wink:

I also currently have a gut feeling somewhere that there is a big opportunity for [Observability analysis, Filtering, System Identification and Robust Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory#Topics_in_control_theory) to get a higher degree of confidence with causal inference & Bayesian methods, but I leave that little brain fart just here to marinate while I am getting a grasp of the main material first...


## Reference Material
The main books and sites I am currently very much engaged with. I am trying to keep the list as short as possible on any given topic, because be honest, who really has the time next to their day jobs to dive into 5 different university level textbooks for a single topic. Even in university you just had one main text book per topic/course...

#### Bayesian
- **Richard McElreath - [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)**
I am crazy impressed with how he has reworked the course in 2023/2024 (vs. my last time watching some lectures in 2019) and how he has worked into it a massive focus on causality. So going through the entire course again. My tip would be to get the book as well, because it does dive a bit more into the mathematics behind it, but still very much focussed on also getting the philisophical thoughts behind Bayesian modelling across.

#### Causal Inference

- **Matheus Facure - [Causal Inference in Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/causal-inference-in/9781098140243/)** (as well as his _free_ blog [Causal Inference for the Brave & True](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/landing-page.html))
Very fun and easily accessible intro into the basic topics of Causal Inference with many references into deep dives, but mainly very nice and pragmatic.
- Currently browsing many different textbooks to get to a more fundamental/mathematical grasp of it... Feel free to suggest one!
